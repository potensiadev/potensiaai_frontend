## Backend API Configuration

This frontend requires a FastAPI backend to be running. You have two options:

### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended)

1. Clone the backend repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/potensiadev/potensia_ai.git
cd potensia_ai
```

2. Set up Python environment and install dependencies:
```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your `.env` file with required API keys (OpenAI, etc.)

4. Start the backend server:
```sh
python main.py
# Server will run on http://localhost:8000
```

5. Update your frontend `.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
```

### Option 2: Railway Production

If you have deployed the backend to Railway:

1. Get your Railway deployment URL
2. Update the `.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL="https://your-app.up.railway.app"
```

### Testing the API Connection

After starting the backend, you can test the connection:
```sh
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"ok","app":"PotensiaAI","env":"development"}
```
